ASAP or it won't function:
    Advancements
        TorchOnAStick.json
            "criteria": {
                "TorchCrafted":"minecraft:impossible",
                "RedstoneTorchCrafted": "minecraft:impossible",
                "SoulTorchCrafted": "minecraft:impossible"},
                    Item needed names aren't functional
            "rewards": {
                "recipes": [
                    "LanternArrow",
                    "SoulLanternArrow"]}
                        These aren't 1. real recipes that exist and 2. not formatted right (do I need to put LanternArrow.json?)
            "requirements": [],
                I don't understand what goes in this section.
                There is little documentation that I understand (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Advancement/JSON_format#Legend)
    Recipes
        TorchArrow.json
            Needs to be a functional recipe

When a custom item is made fix:
    Advancements
        TorchOnAStick.json
            Icon needs to be TorchArrow item
    Recipes
        TorchArrow.json
            "result": {
		        "item": "minecraft:fire"
		            need to be TorchArrow item

When I have time:
    All
        Rename to fit proper naming scheme (lowercase_underscore_for_spaces)
    Advancements
