# Willow's Arrows
A Minecraft data-pack that allows a player to place torches with a bow.
Being built for Minecraft 1.19

# Project Update
  The thing is IDK if a datapack was the right angle to accomplish the goal of placing arrows with torches.
  Also this is a prime example of me taking a bit too much on my plate then just getting lost in all the things I need to get done.
  I won't send this project to the graveyard just yet.
  There is a possibility that I could re-invent this as a propper mod (even though this idea is for sure already a mod it will help me get 
  my head around some game dev princaples and basic java)
